            STL: map with string as key â€” access speedup
================================================================================

`Speedup accesing map with strings as keys`__. Instead of single std::map
there is table of maps (addressed in O(1) time) storing keys that share
same properies:

* equal length
* equal first char (one level trie)
* both

On my system the best speedup occured for third method.
