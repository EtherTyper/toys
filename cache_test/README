Program shows how cache affects on speed.
Simply type make to build.


First program allocates memory and read all
values table sequentially.  Then indices to
the table are shuffled and again all values
are read, but in random order.


Below is a sample session from my computer:

$ ./test 10000000
sequential scan... took 0.05s
shuffling indexes...
random scan... took 0.27s
slower 5.660 times

$ ./test 100000000
sequential scan... took 0.44s
shuffling indexes...
random scan... took 3.57s
slower 8.193 times
