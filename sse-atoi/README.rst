                SSE: conversion text into numbers
================================================================================

An SSE version of the standard function ``atoi``. Although SIMD code is
feasible, its performance is pretty poor. It is slightly faster than naive
scalar code.

Type ``make`` to build a demo program. Run ``demo`` without arguments to
get help.
